## Hi, I’m Yash

I’m a BCA (Data Science & AI) student who enjoys building
backend and full-stack systems, and experimenting with how
LLMs can be used in real products.

Most of my work is around APIs, backend logic, and systems
that need to be reliable and easy to reason about.
I prefer building practical things over demos.

---

### What I’m currently working on
- Backend and full-stack applications using REST APIs
- LLM-based systems where outputs need to be explainable
- Learning how cost and performance affect real systems
- Running services locally using Docker and Linux

---

### Projects
- **LLM Decision Engine with Explainability**  
  A backend service where an LLM makes simple decisions
  (approve / review / block) and explains the reasoning.
  Built to understand how AI decisions can be audited.

- **Cost-Aware LLM Inference Platform**  
  An API for serving LLM responses while tracking latency
  and basic usage metrics to understand cost trade-offs.

- **Tutor Platform (Web + Backend)**  
  A full-stack web application where tutors can manage
  courses, upload recorded content, host live sessions,
  and interact with students through quizzes and polls.
  Focused on backend APIs, data flow, and scalability.

### Tech I use
**Backend / Full Stack**  
Python, FastAPI, Node.js, JavaScript  
SQL (PostgreSQL / MySQL), REST APIs  

**Frontend (Web)**  
React, HTML, CSS  

**AI / LLM**  
LLM inference, Hugging Face Transformers  

**Tools**  
Docker, Linux, Git, GitHub

---

### What I focus on
- Writing readable backend code
- Understanding system behavior, not just features
- Learning by building and improving projects over time

I’m actively working on these projects and refining them.
