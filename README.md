## Hi, I’m Yash 👋

I’m a BCA (Data Science & AI) student focused on building
**backend, full-stack, and LLM-based systems** that are practical,
reliable, and production-oriented.

I’m especially interested in how AI is used inside real products —
where backend engineering, system design, cost awareness, and reliability
matter more than demos or UI polish.

### 🔧 What I’m working on
- Backend and full-stack applications with clean REST APIs
- LLM-based systems used for decisions, not just chat
- Cost, reliability, and explainability in AI systems
- Dockerized services and Linux-based development

---

### 📌 Selected Projects
- **LLM Decision Engine with Explainability**  
  Backend system where an LLM makes decisions (approve / review / block)
  and generates explanations for audit and reliability use cases.

- **Cost-Aware LLM Inference Platform**  
  API service that serves LLM responses while tracking latency,
  token usage, and cost-aware request handling.

- **Payment & Risk Simulation Platform (Full Stack)**  
  End-to-end system that simulates payment processing with
  rule-based risk checks and an admin dashboard.

### 🧠 Tech Stack
**Backend & Full Stack**  
Python · FastAPI · Node.js · JavaScript  
SQL (PostgreSQL / MySQL) · REST APIs  

**Frontend**  
React · HTML · CSS  

**AI & LLMs**  
LLM inference · Hugging Face Transformers  

**Infrastructure & Tools**  
Docker · Linux · Git · GitHub

### 🎯 What I care about
- Building systems that actually ship
- Clean backend design and readable code
- Using AI responsibly in real-world products
- Learning by building and improving continuously

I’m actively developing these projects and adding depth over time.
